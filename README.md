This is a silly practice program that simply checks a bunch of numbers (0 to the number you give it on the command line, or 1024 by default) and sees which one has the highest number of other numbers that divide evenly into it.

I did make it library-based, and had some fun figuring out how to make an 'object-oriented' C API that hid internal structures.

I'm gonna release this under the LGPL version 3.
